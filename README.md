# KISS GAME ENGINE
### A 2D Game Engine Written in Python, running in Python and For Python Game Developpers. 

Its intend is to provide python game developpers with an easy API to learn to build their own 2D games and provide the possibility to  write little to very big games.

It is built on top of the [pyglet](https://pyglet.org) library for rendering, and a python version of a great physics engine named [Box2D](https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d). So you can expect it to be of top quality.

If you have any issue you can add an issue to the repository. I will be very pleased to help.

### Prerequisities 
  - Python >= 3.7
  - pyglet >= 1.4.0
  - pybox2d [See How to install it here](https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
  - pyglet_ffmpeg2
 
### Functionnalities availables :
System | Components
------------ | -------------
  Rendering | Simple Shapes (squares, circles, triangles),  Sprites
  Physics Engine | Colliders (BoxColliders, CircleColiders, PolygonColliders, TrianlgeColliders, EdgeColliders), RigidBodies
  Audio Engine | Play Sound, Loop Sound
  
### TODO
  - Animation System :
      - Frame By Frame with Sprites
      - From Sequence of images on one Spritesheet
      - From GIF
  - Particle Sytem
  - 2D Light System
  - GUI System
  - Editor
